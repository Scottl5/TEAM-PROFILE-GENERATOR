# TEAM-PROFILE-GENERATOR

## Description

This homework uses the inquire module in the command line to prompt a user with question to develop a team. Based off the answers provided, an html page is created displaying cards with each individual employee. This homework is a work in progress as there is not much to it, but I will be continuing to update it within the upcoming week
